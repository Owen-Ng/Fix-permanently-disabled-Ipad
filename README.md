# Fix-permanently-disabled-Ipad-WITHOUT-DATA-LOSS
If your Ipad is disabled permanently and you know the password. You are in the right place

## What you need:

- Itune
- Your password to unlock the Ipad
- An apple cable
- IOS must be older than the present IOS

Note: It work for me with an old Ipad with outdated OS. No external application can fix such issue as they all need your PC authorization which in this case I did not have. 

# Step:

- Set your Ipad to recovery mode. (Hold both the upper button and the lower center button until a weird screen show up) You can google how to have your device in recovery mode or just go to this link https://www.imore.com/how-to-iphone-ipad-recovery-mode.
- connect your ipad to your PC 
- Your PC will prompt you to update or restore the device (VERY IMPORTANT you need to click on Update)
- (DONT CLICK ON RESTORE) Restore will delete all your data (DONT CLICK ON RESTORE) 
- Then just wait.
- Your Ipad might turn on with the disabled issue again. This means that the update did not proceed. Unplug your device and start from step 1 again.
- Then if it worked successfully, it will show an error like "could not be updated an unknown error occurred -1" on your PC.
- The Ipad will light on and say wait for 1 hour to be able to enter your password. 
- Just follow the instruction and you are all set no DATA LOSS and a perfectly functioning device
